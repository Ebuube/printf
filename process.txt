#	THIS ENUMERATES THE PROCESS WE ARE GOING TO USE TO WRITE THE PROGRAM

## basically a pseudocode.

Given an input example
_printf("Hello World %c. How is %s? My battery is 15%%.", 'm', "my_name");

The format string is
	"Hello World %c. How is %s? My battery is 15%%."

START

LET counter = 0
LET my_char
LET my_string

WHILE NOT(End of format string)
	my_char = Get one character from the format string
	IF the my_char is not '%'
		print it to stdout
		counter = counter + 1 /* Increment counter by 1 */
		NEXT ITERATION
	ELSE
		my_char = Get the next character from the format string
		/* Using a switch statement to work on the next character */

		switch (my_char)
		{
		case 'c':
			/* get next argument as character from the variable list */
			my_char = next-argument
			/* call write_char function to print my_char and
			and increment counter by one */
			write_char(my_char)
			counter = counter + 1
			NEXT ITERATION
		case 's':
			/* get next argument as string from the variable list */
			my_string = next-argument
			/* print the string and add its length to the counter */
			write_string(my_string)
			counter = counter + length_of_string(my_string)
			NEXT ITERATION
		case '%':
			/* just print this percent sign and increment counter */
			write_char('%')
			counter = counter + 1
			NEXT ITERATION
		}


IMPORTANT NOTICE

This _printf() function uses a variable argument list.
